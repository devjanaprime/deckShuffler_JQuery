JQuery Deck Shuffler
========================

Continuing the Vanilla JS Deck Shuffler exercise (https://github.com/devjanaprime/deckShuffler), this will project will incorporate JQuery (ver 1.12.3) and keep things pretty much the same as the earlier project. Perhaps with some JQuery pizzaz.

Note: That is likely the first time I've used "pizzaz" in a sentence.
